# Sylvia's Portfolio

## What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
- The most challenging part of this assignment was using CSS to fine-tune the style of elements.
- I found web development with only html and css is quite challenging, especially the nav bar for mobile and web views. 
- It took me around two days to complete the overall assignment.

## What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
- To make my site mobile-friendly, I used media queries to ensure a responsive design. I adapted the layout and styling to different screen sizes. Specifically, when the device screen is less than or equals to the width of iPad Air, I use smaller font size and closer element styles to adjust the layout.


## What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
- When developing the design of my website, I took into account color schemes and grid layouts. I chose pink and light-green as the main color theme. As for the picture gallery, I used grid to adjust the layout since each of my picture's size is different.
- I'm particularly proud of how these elements contribute to the overall visual appeal.


## Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
- If given more time or resources, I would enhance the navigation bar behavior.
- Currently, the navbar color won't change after clicking due to limitations on using JavaScript in this assignment.
- With more resources, I would improve this aspect.

## How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
- I spent one day (around 4 hours) on HTML to lay out the website, gather texts, and collect pictures.
- The following day (aroung 10 hours) was dedicated to working on the CSS. Most of my time was spent on adjusting nav bar. I tried several plans but most of them couldn't work out without the help of javascript. In the end, I just use the most naive way to change the view of nav bar under different views.

## If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they
- I assumed that the pages are consecutive instead of separate entities, guiding my approach to the overall structure of the website. Currently the content flows consecutively rather than existing as separate, standalone entities. This assumption decided the structure of my website and determined the logical flow of page infomation.
